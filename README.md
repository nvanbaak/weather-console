## Description

Weather Console is a skills development exercise to practice using APIs.  It combines user-provided input, dynamic handling of API data, and use of localstorage to save your search history.  Certain content (such as the background color of the UV box and weather icons) changes based on what data is displayed.

## Usage

The functionality is pretty simple: just type a city into the search bar and it'll find it for you.  If the city doesn't exist, it'll display an error message instead of searching and the typo search won't be saved in your search history.  (Though be advised that there are *many* cities in the world and some of them look like typos of other cities -- for example, did you know that Pairs, France is a real place?)
